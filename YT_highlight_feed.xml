<h2>Start by Selling High-Ticket or Low-Ticket, Not Mid-Ticket</h2>
When building a business from scratch, it's easier to either sell very expensive offers to a small number of clients or very cheap products to everyone. The middle ground is tough and often where businesses struggle. Selling high-ticket, especially one-on-one services, gives you more cash flow and direct feedback early on, helping you fund and scale the business later.
<h2>The Power of Unscalable High-Ticket Offers</h2>
Offering premium, unscalable services—like personalized one-on-one time—enables quick learning, builds strong relationships with higher value clients, and provides better cash flow upfront. Though unscalable, such offers raise your prices due to limited supply, create powerful branding, generate valuable case studies, and shift your perspective about what's possible to charge and deliver.
<h2>Everyone Trades Time for Money—Optimize Yours</h2>
Every person earns money per hour, whether it’s explicit or not. The key is to raise your hourly rate by charging more, especially when starting out. Don’t be afraid to sell your time at a premium if the price makes it worth your while, and realize that even investors and the wealthiest people ultimately exchange time, experience, and attention for income.
<h2>High-Ticket Offers Improve All Other Offers</h2>
Having a very expensive offer increases perceived value throughout your business, even for your lower-priced products. Listing a high price publicly anchors expectations, boosts your brand status, and lets cheaper versions appear more affordable and attractive. Even if few buy, the existence of a high-ticket product doubles your revenue potential and profit margins with minimal extra clients.
<h2>Reverse Engineering Premium Value</h2>
To create compelling high-ticket offers, imagine what you’d include if you charged 10x or 100x more, and build from there. Design offers that are so valuable they generate word-of-mouth, and focus on the unique needs and pains of higher-end clients. Always start by picking the right customer avatar for these premium services.
<h2>Perceived Likelihood of Outcome and Speed Matter Most</h2>
Clients buy expensive one-on-one services because they believe they'll achieve their desired result faster and with greater certainty. Raising prices enables you to pay vendors and staff for priority treatment, further boosting speed. Speed and reliability are even more persuasive to buyers than magnitude of results, especially for high-income customers.
<h2>Bootstrap Growth by Using Premium Clients for Cash Flow</h2>
Dedicate a portion of your time to premium, high-margin offers, using that income to fund and accelerate the rest of your business. This approach lets you test ideas, improve your service, and support growth in a sustainable way, without sacrificing long-term scalability.]]></description>
