            Monthly Business Aha's = MBA; to make serious decisions you need numbers and a good funnel; when you are in exploration mode an MVP is enough; it is more important to know who buys your product than who uses it; to identify the ICP ask your current customers; clients can be fans or value exchangers.

        <p class="giustifica">
            This series was born out of a desire to have something regular on my blog.
            <br>
            Since I often find myself thinking about and discussing my activities with friends, I decided to share the
            most important lessons of the month, in the hope that they might be useful (or even just interesting) to
            someone.
            <br>
            “<b>Monthly Business Aha's</b>” is just to make fun of MBAs.

            <a href="#h1.2">■ Don't change your price, contents, strategy, or anything really... until you have enough
                numbers</a>
        </h2>
        <p class="giustifica">
            <i>To make decisions, you need data, and to get data, you need numbers.</i>
            <br><br>
            At the beginning of January, I was working with a dysfunctional spaghetti funnel: it was impossible to
            measure, wasted our energy, and was labyrinthine (we were moving people through 5-6 steps).
            <br>We transformed the funnel into three simple steps, and now the problem is measurable and actionable: we
            don't have to feed three or four openings of the funnel, but only one.
            <br><br>
            In hindsight, it's a very trivial thing, and I'm surprised I didn't notice it sooner.
            <br>I mean: <b>IT'S CALLED A FUNNEL, NOT A SPAGHETTI BOWL!</b>
            <br>This is an interesting aspect of “doing business”: the fact that you have to make some mistakes in order
            to
            internalize them, even if they are absolutely trivial.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h1.3">
            <a href="#h1.3">■ Exploration is cool... but it costs time</a>
        </h2>
        <p class="giustifica">
            <i>Exploring is important, but be prepared to trash projects and sacrifice time.</i>
            <br><br>
            In the spaghetti funnel mentioned, we had a hypothesis: by inviting YouTube Shorts doom scrollers, we
            would increase live viewers, newsletter subscriptions, and ultimately sales.
            <br>We tried online services that extract highlights from live streams, but they are too expensive and
            create
            low-quality shorts.<br> So I implemented an <a
                href="../mainPages/Projects.html#YT-shorts-automation">automation</a> <b>that took me
                a month</b> and costs much less.
            <br><br>
            After a couple of months, we concluded that the hypothesis is false: out of a dozen weekly shorts, we had
            50K monthly shorts views and... 8 conversions per month to live streams.
            <br><br>
            It wasn't a failure: we explored and excluded this possibility.
            <br>But in hindsight, knowing that we could have discarded it, I would have spent less time and created a
            less
            perfect tool (more of an MVP), so that we could test and decide without investing too many resources in
            something potentially useless.
            <br>(In my defense: it worked with Hormozi, so why shouldn't it work with us???)

            A friend and I are considering a product to sell to Italian doctors.
            <br>After a quick analysis, we identified three major competitors selling similar products.
            <br>BUT: they sell large packages to local government entities that manage doctors, while we would sell
            directly
            to doctors (who are self-employed but have a government contract... Italian bureaucracy, don't ask).
            <br><br>
            This is a basic lesson for startups, but I'm glad it came in handy and didn't remain in the hyperuranium of
            business ideas.

            I was thinking about the ICP of a business I work with when I realized that two factors determine the best
            type of customer: <i>age</i> and <i>experience with competitors</i>.
            <br>How did I realize this? By investigating current customers.
            <br>Once I noticed this, I had forms filled out for each customer in order to gather as much information as
            possible. <br>And now we have a very clear ICP.
            <br>This is not an original idea: as often happens to me, I think I internalized it after reading a <a
                href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/target-market/#:~:text=When%20in%20doubt%2C%20go%20back,each%20other%E2%80%99s%20testimonials%20as%20compelling"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post by A Smart Bear</a>.
            <br>I find it funny to think that before doing the obvious (talking to current customers), I was searching
            for
            who-knows-what strategy to identify ICPs...
            <br><br>
            I think I'm at the stage where I believe that since we're talking about business, i.e. “<i>serious
                stuff</i>,” we
            need <i>serious</i> solutions.

            <a href="#h1.6">■ Fans vs customers</a>
        </h2>
        <p class="giustifica">
            <i>Are your clients fans or customers?</i>
            <br><br>
            It all started with a <a
                href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/willingness-to-pay/#three-kinds-wtp"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very interesting post on A Smart Bear</a>.
            <br> I have dealt with two businesses that have two different types of customers (according to the post):
            “<b>allies</b>” and “<b>value exchangers.</b>”
            <br>The difference I noticed between these two (both in the coaching sector) is the type of value that
            clients
            receive: <i>subjective</i> and <i>objective</i>.
            <br><br>
            When you can say, “<i>You give me X$ and with my knowledge you will make +Y%</i>,” the customer pulls out
            their
            calculator, and if it’s worth it, they find out if they like the product, and then they buy it.
            <br>Marketing is
            standard: you explain what you do, show social proof, do webinars...
            <br>It becomes an exchange of value, and customers are “<b>value exchangers</b>”: they expect +Y% in
            exchange for
            X$.
            <br><br>
            When you sell writing coaching (teaching a writing method), you encounter people saying “<i>But author XXX
                does the opposite! And he is wealthy and famous!</i>” because we are not dealing with objective data.
            <br>Specifically regarding writing methods, the prevailing belief is that there is no correct approach (even
            though the opposite can be demonstrated...).
            <br>In my limited experience, this greatly complicates marketing and makes it difficult to convert skeptics.
            <br>However, this situation creates a few big fans who buy and are VERY satisfied (ALL customers have told
            us
            that they got MUCH more value than the price, sometimes even 10 times more value!).
            <br>Essentially, you win by creating fans, not by attracting customers.
            <br><br>
            The problem lies in the fact that the game takes place on a subjective level, which makes it difficult to
            manage.
            <br>In the objective case of “<i>X$ in exchange for +Y%</i>,” if a person does not trust the deal, they know
            that
            they are leaving “<i>+Y%</i>” on the table.
            <br>They can compare it with other similar (equally objective) products and can objectively decide whether
            it is
            a good purchase (“<i>X$ is a fraction of what I earn, even if it doesn't work, it's worth trying if I could
                earn +Y%</i>”).
            <br><br>
            In the subjective case, however, opinion comes into play: products cannot be compared and it is difficult to
            understand whether it's worth the price.
            <br> If they think, “<i>That's not true! Stephen King writes in this other way...</i>” it is VERY difficult
            to change
            their mind.
            <br> (Not impossible: behavioral change exists, but it takes time, money, and expertise.)
            <br><br>
            BUT!
            <br>There is a shortcut: bring the game back to an objective level.
            <br>There are writing coaches who make a fortune selling the <i>promise</i> of publication.
            <br>They show that many of their clients have been published (with publishers they work with...), so the
            offer
            becomes “<i>X$ in exchange for (the possibility of) publication.</i>”
            <br>Clients become “value exchangers” again, and the business dynamics become the usual ones.
            <br>(NOTE: promising to publish is almost always (in order to avoid being sued...) a lie, given how
            publishing
            works in Italy, so this is a path we are NOT taking).
            <br><br>
            Next month, I hope to be able to offer a lesson on “<i>How to manage customer-fans</i>,” but for now, I have
            only
            realized that there are different types of customers.
