            </h3>

            <p>
                Academia isn’t for me (==LINK==) I used to believe that research meant juggling ideas and advancing
                humanity’s scientific
                understanding.
                <br />
                Turns out, it’s a hellscape of publications and citation games.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I was realizing that, I came across the book <a
                    href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8044351-the-power-of-business-process-improvement"
                    target="_blank">The Power of Business Process Improvement</a>. That book gave me hope: maybe there
                <i>are</i> jobs where you analyze problems and solve them (much like the science I believed in)! So I
                thought: <i>“Why not try something more... business?”</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                After some research, the roles I was looking for turned out to be <i>Operational Efficiency</i> and
                <i>Business Process Improvement</i>. At that stage, even figuring out the right roles felt
                like progress.
                <br />
                But like in every fairy tale, it didn’t take long to spot the catch: <b>those are corporate roles</b>.
                <br />
                Still, not knowing what I was getting into, I told myself <i>“Gotta start somewhere,”</i> and started
                applying.
            </p>

            <mark>==IMAGE 2==</mark>

            <p>
                In those corporate positions, the preferred background is a degree in business management.
                <br />
                As a mathematician, I had to submit a <i>lot</i> of applications and go through three interviews before
                landing an offer: a 6-month internship in Italy as an <b>Operational Excellence Intern</b>, paying
                <b>$7/hour</b>.
                <br />
                I expected the worst from a corporate role, but the interviews went surprisingly well: the HR rep was
                friendly and helpful; the supervisor was sharp, professional, and asked smart questions. I was sold: I
                accepted the offer without
                hesitation.

            <p>It can be divided into 3 phases</p>

            <h3 id="the-wow-i-have-a-badge-phase">

            </h3>
            <p>
                On Day 1, I badged through three layers of security and felt like “This is a <i>serious</i> place.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I mean: the safety course at the digital kiosk, the corporate benefits brochure, the jaw-dropping
                production volumes... I walked through it all with wide eyes.</p>
            <p>
                Once I put on my PPE and stepped into the production area, I saw cutting-edge ⧫ manufacturing.
                <br />
                That wasn’t a normal site: it’s the company’s jewel.
                <br />
                “<i>And I’m here, ambitious and ready to contribute</i>”
            </p>
            <p>Then Day 2 happened.</p>

            <h3 id="the-ah-phase">
                <a href="#the-ah-phase">└─ The “<em>Ah</em>” phase</a>
            </h3>
            <p>The part where I actually do the job.</p>
            <p>
                In my case:
            <ul>
                <li>Sending out a PowerBI dashboard every morning</li>
                <li>Translating slides from English</li>
                <li>Measuring tables with tape measure to buy some panels</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                And the team’s work is not better:
            <ul>
                <li>Running health-checks (checklists)</li>
                <li>Teaching operators</li>
                <li>Many, many meetings</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                “<i>Ah.</i>”
                <br />
                “<i>I came here to solve business problems and I’m translating slides.</i>”
            </p>

            <p>
                After a month, I had a 1:1 with my supervisor to plan the rest of the internship. Three projects were on
                the table:
            <ul>
                <li>2-3 months building a PowerBI automation</li>
                <li>Support one production line with organizing maintenance</li>
                <li>A TBD project to convince a stakeholder (e.g., the quality team) to hire me post-internship</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                My response was:
            <ul>
                <li>If I wanted to do data analysis (PowerBI etc.), I’d be doing it elsewhere at triple the salary
                    (remember: 7$/h)</li>
                <li>I came here for operational efficiency, not people management</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer: “These are the team’s needs. There’s no flexibility.”
                <br />
                My answer: “Then this doesn’t align with my goals. I am done here.”
            </p>

                Beyond my assigned tasks, I saw so much dysfunction I couldn’t help but start taking notes.
                <br />
                A lot of notes. 10,000 words. In just one month.

                Coming off another experience (<mark>==LINK==</mark>), one rule I’d imposed on

            <p>Here’s how my first day <i>actually</i> went.</p>
            <p>
                No one told me when to show up, so I arrived early. The receptionist didn’t know what to do and told me
                to call my supervisor.
                <br />
                “<i>I don’t have the number</i>”
                <br />
                “<i>I have it. We’ll call around 8.</i>”
                <br />
                We find out my supervisor was on vacation. We escalated to his manager, who came
                to pick me up at 9 like a parent picking up a lost kid at customer
                service.
            </p>
            <p>
                A week later: induction day.
                <br />
                Again: no one told me the time.
                <br />
                I had to crash the event and (surprise!) wasn’t even on the attendance list!
                <br />
                For an <b>obligatory</b> event where we had to sign documents!!!
            </p>
            <p>
                I quickly realize that “a big company works <i>only</i> if everything works well” is <b>bullshit</b>.
                The chaos is
                managed <i>just</i> enough to not collapse.
            </p>
            <p>
                People <i>inside</i> are the first to point this out, forced to “keep things afloat via WhatsApp
                messages and Teams calls”.
                <br />
                The same company that claims to be “one of the most advanced in the world,” flexing ISO certifications
                (= days full of meetings) ...and yet it runs on iPhones, Microsoft PCs, and outdated software.
            </p>
            <p>
                But still: the plant produces █–██ million ⧫ per day, sold at █$ per unit, across ██ operational lines,

                This plant was built in a perfect location.
            </p>
            <p>
                Central enough to attract young workers from the South (fleeing mafia and irregular labor) and
                immigrants (chasing a better life): a steady, self-replacing stream of labor; and north enough to pull
                in graduates from top universities for management roles. On top of that, the local man <i>loves</i>
                getting his hands dirty: the perfect profile to fill an army of ████ operators. This plant wouldn’t work
                otherwise: too much mafia further south, too many managers further north.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most tasks are now standardized and require minimal skill.
                <br />
                Which means: <b><i>almost</i> anyone can do <i>almost</i> anything</b>. The real challenge isn’t
                the job, <i>it’s surviving the corporate environment</i>.
                <br />
                So hiring is done in bulk.
                <br />
                If someone quits? No big deal: easy to replace.
                <br />
                (I’d hear “Today is X’s last day” <i>every</i> week.)
                <br />
                If someone endures the corporate life and (optionally) knows how to do the job: great!
                <br />
                A new pawn gets promoted, and a new batch moves in. Besides manufacturing slaves for the C-level,
                this strategy fuels the narrative: <b>“Anyone can make it.”</b> Among the (low level) managers,
                you’ll find former machine operators, shop assistants, even cops. Not because they have rare skills,
                but because they could tolerate the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interns are a different story.
                <br />
                They’re usually graduates with degrees that don’t translate into jobs (I was the exception)
                <br />
                Basically: desperates. They’re thrown into <i>menial</i> tasks (to say the least…) and 90% of the time
                they’re not hired after the internship.
                <br />
                But is still a great deal! Not for them, for the company: internships are funded by the regional
                government.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s talk about machine operators. They’re people used to working with their hands, with strong manual
                skills, excellent spatial awareness, and work well together on the production floor.
                <br />
                In short: they’re the kind of people you want to keep the machines running.

                Now, what does the team I landed in actually do?
                <br />
                Here’s how my supervisor explained it:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>"Our goal is to build a lean mindset.
                    <br />
                    In 20 years, resources will be scarce, but we can use this time to trigger a cultural shift.
                    <br />
                    Since operators are the ones doing the actual work, we (white collars) are the loss.
                    <br />
                    Our job is to make up for their lack of self-management by teaching them to become self-sufficient.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                In practice: teaching operators how to do the job “by the standard”,
                and keeping them in check. How? By taking them from production and
                sticking them in a classroom with slides.
                <br />
                Then taking their supervisors, scoring their performance, and giving
                them grades.
            </p>
            <p>
                Put yourself in the shoes of an operator who’s been doing this
                for years.
                <br />
                He knows every part of the machine, can fix any issue, and sees the next
                ones coming.
                <br />
                Wearing oil-stained shirts and technician pants, he sees us show up in
                jeans and button-downs to explain that every time he cleans the machine,
                he has to fill out a form. And whenever there’s a problem (even a loose
                screw) he’s supposed to report it to the line lead, who logs it in the
                system, runs an assessment, solves it, and logs the solution back
                in.
            </p>
            <p>
                The plant runs on a fragile balance: a symbiosis between workers and
                machines.
                <br />
                Part of that balance relies on the operator’s personality. For its
                underpaid roles, the company hires <i>pragmatic profiles</i>, referred
                to as “monkeys” in internal jargon (even by upper management) (needless
                to say, I don’t endorse it). These workers aren’t known for
                programmatic, standardized maintenance, so the company hires managers to
                coach them, trying to prevent long-term machine failures. In short: it
                hires people <i>for</i> their practicality, then forces them to act
                <i>against</i> it, risking the very balance that keeps the whole
                system alive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company is fighting a war on two internal fronts, contradicting
                its own methods (see: <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-cannae-problem/" target="_blank">The Cannae
                    Problem</a>). Will it work?
                <br />
                Yes, but not how they think. People are learning how to game the system:
                they log <i>some</i> activities (just enough to show compliance),
                report KPIs only when they look good (otherwise it’s “N/A”), and run
                structured meetings <i>only</i> when someone’s watching. How could it
                work, anyway? This isn’t a solution.
                <br />
                The solution would be: hire different people.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not really a “people problem” you can solve with “people
                solutions”.
                <br />
                <b>The problem <i>is</i> the people</b>.
                <br />
                They fall into two archetypes (borrowed from <a
                    href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Gervaso#Raccolte_di_aforismi" target="_blank">an italian book</a>):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The conformist (the willing slave)</li>
                <li>The ambitious (the one who obeys now, hoping to command later)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The first is the machine operator: the average Italian, obsessed with
                football, ultra-conservative traditionalist, whose biggest dream is
                retirement. He doesn’t want new frameworks and complains about every new
                tool.
                <br />
                The second is the opportunistic manager, a <a
                    href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/" target="_blank">Gervais
                    Principle sociopath-in-training</a>. Secretly loyal to hierarchy, but
                never shows it (to avoid alienating the conformists around him). He
                obeys with strategic discipline, hoping to rise to the top of the
                pyramid.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The company is inherently pathological because is built out of what sabotages it.</b>
                <br />
                It’s a problem that can’t be solved, because it’s not just <i>compatible</i> with the company’s
                existence, the company actually
                <i>depends</i> on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Which leads to the real question: <i>If the problem is the people... why do the people stay?</i>

            <p>
                When they told me there’s a free gym, free bus pass, and free
                cafeteria, I thought: “<i>$7/hour is low, but it’s my first experience
                    in this field, and the perks aren’t bad.</i>”
            </p>
            <p>
                These is the bullshit that got me, and the same ones that convince
                people to stay.
                <br />
                And the company offers plenty: $100 bonuses for Christmas and birthdays,
                <em>recognition cards</em>, a huge end-of-year party, 5 free coffees a
                day, a free therapist, book clubs… It’s the only way to make the job
                bearable: distract with anything <i>except</i> the job itself.
                <br />
                I mean: a $100 annual voucher sounds better than $8.50 more in your
                paycheck.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s be clear: we’re manufacturing ⧫ here.

                We’re not changing the world, we’re not making it a better place. We’re
                producing ⧫.
                <br />
                This can’t be a <em>raison d’être</em>. But the job keeps people
                occupied, and the benefits keep people distracted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most don’t quit, and yet they complain every day, always finishing
                with: <b>“Well, at least we get paid for it.”</b>
                <br />
                Once I
                replied, “Weak consolation...”, the supervisor didn’t hesitate:
                <b>“Fat consolation!”</b>
                <br />
                Self-persuasion keeps them going.

                Italians have a complicated relationship with their country.
                “<i>Italy is the most beautiful country in the world</i>” but then
                “<i>Politics is a disaster, salaries are low, taxes are insane...</i>”
                When I told interns about opportunities abroad, they’d reply “<i>Then why did you come back?</i>” with
                that smug undertone “<i>You love
                    Italy too much, huh?</i>” Like the golden prison employees, they
                survive through cognitive dissonance. They <i>know</i> things are
                better elsewhere, but need to remind themselves why they stay: the food,
                the sea, the family... From birth Italians are molded to <b><a
                        href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Simp" target="_blank">simp</a> for

                <i>nostalgia effect</i>.
                <br />
                Instead of fixing structural problems, they lure talent back from abroad
                (<a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/06/italy-facts-of-the-day.html"

                Italy: <b>a country that gives up on its future by accepting what

                I hoped to connect with the other interns by sharing the ideas from
                this post, but I realized they had no perspective. “<i>I just want a
                    normal job. One where I leave at 5pm and don’t have to think about
                    anything. As long as they pay me, I’m good.</i>”
                <br />
                How does a 25-year-old
                end up with that as a life vision? I believe it’s the country: its work

                A few weeks in, I went to pick up some PPE, and that’s when I had
                <i>the vision</i>. A guy, maybe 20 years old, was managing deliveries
                from the warehouse.
                <br />
                He was slouched in his chair like someone who had been sitting there all
                day.
                <br />
                At the computer, holding a roll of tape. Trying to find the end of it.
                Five minutes passed. Same position, still searching, with no success. A
                young mind, capable of who knows what, being paid to find the end of a
                roll of tape. Something hit me.
                <br />
                It was sadness, sharp and overwhelming. I understood and I wanted to do
                something. I wanted to shake him.
                <br />
                To wake him up.
                <br />
                To sound like a lunatic if I had to, but tell him to get out.<br />
                That he could do anything with his life.<br />
                That the world is full of opportunities.<br />
                That he was wasting his time with that roll of tape, at that desk, in
                that company. I wanted to do the same with the other interns.<br />
                To break the corporate trance.<br />
                Not just them: I wanted to tell <i>everyone</i>. They all deserve to
                know.

                I deeply believe that understanding the <i>concept of value</i> is
                one of the most important skills a person can develop.
                <br />
                From product pricing to the value of time, it underpins everything.
                Living alone has drastically sharpened this skill for me (though I

            <p>The corporate job is a subtle game of value. The most
                pathological belief is that money is the only value at stake.<br />
                This ignores, for instance, the <b>value of identity</b>:
                <i>“What is the cost of becoming the person you want to become?”</i>
                Spending years in a company means <i>growing inside it</i> and
                <i>being shaped to fit its walls</i>.

                    The deal makes sense until I have enough money to comfortably avoid
                    homelessness, then each dollar gets less and less valuable, but society

            <p>
                Once I got the job, friends asked: <i>“What do you do? How much are you making?”</i>
                <br />
                No one asked: <i>“At what cost?”</i>
                <br />
                To most people, <i>cost</i> just means money. And money flows one way: from company to employee.
                <br />
                But we’re talking about <i>value</i>, and money is only a part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a company like this, the cost is <b>the death of ambition</b>. Why would an intern, hired after
                months of job
                searching, even consider leaving?
                <br />
                They convince themselves this is as good as it gets, and settle.
                <br />
                Week after week, they start hoping they can stay forever. Maybe climb the
                ladder.
                <br />
                Their BATNA? Staying on even worse terms than the ones they have
                now. In their defense: it’s also a cultural issue: in Italy the highest
                aspiration is a permanent contract, entrepreneurship is treated like
                gambling, and job hopping is frowned upon.
            </p>
            <p>
                I almost fell for it too: the situation was tough, but that company
                name would’ve looked <i>shiny</i> on a résumé. Still, when I assessed
                the psychological cost, it was too high.
                <br />
                Given my background and financial situation, my BATNA was simple: quit, and find something
                better.
                <br />
                I negotiated (<a href="https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/" target="_blank">always
                    negotiate!</a>).
                <br />
                We couldn’t find alignment.
                <br />
                I walked away.
                <br />
                BATNA!

                I lived that month like someone who had surrendered.
                <br />
                I dreamed of being reprimanded for messing up the report. I watched <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/@TrentTheTraveler" target="_blank">vanlife</a> videos to
                forget the frustration.
                <br />
                I tracked my supervisor’s football team to predict his mood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people are happy doing this kind of job: my parents were, some interns are.
                <br />
                I can’t. And I blame myself, because things would be easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know, I know: “Life is hard, and there’s <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem" target="_blank">no free lunch</a>”
                <br />
                I have no illusion that things are simple outside the corporate world.
                <br />
                But says Murakami: “<i>I can bear any pain as long as it has a meaning.</i>” and manufacturing ⧫ isn’t
                the meaning I’m looking for, nor is making my boss happy.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I’m looking for is <a
