            I spent the last year in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz" target="_blank">Graz</a> working on my master's thesis and for my first (and last) job as a researcher.
            <br>
            To recap the experience, I wrote in random order random stuff that caught my eye.
            <br>
            Don't expect anything, it's just a "<i>list of things</i>".

        <p><b>Students knock on their desks at the end of every university lecture</b> as a form of applause.</p>
        <p>It’s actually better than clapping (less noise) but I was surprised to see that they do it after every single lecture. In Italy, it’s common to clap only at the end of a course, as a way to thank the professor for the effort.</p>  
        <p></p>  
        <p>Looks like Austrians are more thankful than Italians.</p>

        <p>On the last working day before Christmas and before Easter, the head of the department brought themed chocolates for everyone.</p>

        <p>It’s the Austrian way of saying <i>goodbye</i>.</p>
        <p>But the <i>b</i> in <i>baba</i> is pronounced so strongly it sounds like a <i>p</i>, which makes it basically <i>papa</i>, which means “father” in Italian and many other languages. </p> 
        <p>Also: <a href="https://youtu.be/MhmRglN7_CA?t=215" target="_blank">it sounds funny</a>.</p>

        <p>I was happy to discover that <b>in Graz a lot of people wear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist_shoe" target="_blank">barefoot shoes</a></b>. </p>

        <p>About a year before moving to Austria, I had bought my <a href="https://www.amazon.it/SAGUARO-Barefoot-Shoes-Donna-Scarpe/dp/B0CQ2MV12X?__mk_it_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1O3CPLBV1ENRF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.jV0e6ZWh0bcE0eU9bMFU3SCuD08K03FWIKYDeBFelIHEMgCgdoU0sM3oS_SLuAeTHHb_NOkcfztBgSkQY3BrMxa6j9cqzH62KJrzRZhzq5PFP8mvYfsDGSlm0MKPuxC8-CyCq1ItwVIK6uOI6_igXLbxX-0E2TZNRsV-wBovn02Ys1rqTjiQjIPDC3zcc67JS0fOjIV-fJK2vsQDZcD1ubQx39hiqaSnFcURMMbJ9hIaiSSEg7T5qYg3n-3ZQWGir76SrlHCBBkornTPpuUGibulSd8CJg3FAMMY-HX8Xto.nFzBwd1RNTgVNLD6da57OGLd9zfXgaCrhMBjNNp8H1w&dib_tag=se&keywords=barefoot+shoe&qid=1742837906&sprefix=barefoot+shoe%2Caps%2C102&sr=8-5" target="_blank">first pair</a> and fallen in love with them. But they’re not exactly <i>conventional-looking</i>, especially by Italian standards. 
        So finding myself among people who use them gave me psychological relief.</p>
        <p>It’s not the only case where Austrians prefer <i>practicality</i> over <i>aesthetics</i>: at work, it's typical to wear slippers instead of shoes.</p> 
        <p>In Italy, this is unthinkable.</p>



        <!--  Getting paid for plasma  -->
        <h3 id="Getting_paid_for_plasma">
            <a href="#Getting_paid_for_plasma" class="header_link">└─ Getting paid for plasma</a>
        </h3>

        <p>In Austria, you can donate plasma in exchange for money. You are not getting paid, it's a <i>compensation</i>.</p>
        <p><b>In Italy, this is illegal</b>.</p>
        
        <p>The <a href="https://www.avisbg.it/news/donare-il-sangue-per-soldi-ecco-perche-non-e-possibile-in-italia" target="_blank">reasoning behind the Italian approach</a> includes two main points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reinforcing the altruistic nature of donation</li>
            <li>Avoiding situations where financial incentives might push people in poor health to donate (something supported by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1423-0410.2002.00239.x" target="_blank">scientific papers</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/25/wrong-to-pay-blood-donors-safety-compromised" target="_blank">articles</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Both are valid motivations.</p>
        <p>Still, this doesn’t help solve the ongoing blood shortage in Italian hospitals. I wonder if there could be a middle ground between donation and direct payment. Maybe alternative forms of compensation, like tax deductions or similar mechanisms, something that connects the act of donating to a sense of civic duty, without turning it into a purely financial transaction.</p>
        
        
        <!--  Consequences of free university  -->
        <h3 id="Consequences_of_free_university">
            <a href="#Consequences_of_free_university" class="header_link">└─ Consequences of free university </a>
        </h3>
        <p>For EU students, <b>public universities in Austria are free</b> for the standard duration of the program, plus two additional semesters (see the <a href="https://www.bmbwf.gv.at/en/Topics/Higher-education---universities/Studying/Tuition-fees.html" target="_blank">government website</a>). There’s only a small annual fee of around €20 for the student union.</p>

        <p>On top of that, not only is taxation low, but <b>students also receive monthly financial support from the state</b>, called <i>Studienbeihilfe</i>.
            According to (chatGPT summarizing) the <a href="https://www.stipendium.at/stipendien/studienbeihilfe" target="_blank">official website</a>, this support can range from €150–250 per month if you live with your parents, €500–650 if you live on your own, and up to nearly €1,000 if you’re fully self-sufficient.</p>
            
        <p>Benefits like these simply don’t exist at all in Italy.</p>

        <p>If it’s true that this kind of system helps make higher education more accessible, it also seems to foster another kind of behaviour: <b>low engagement</b>.</p>
        
        <p>Talking with Italian professors, I often hear that Austrian students are significantly less motivated than their Italian counterparts.
        Part of me thinks this is just the usual <i>“young people today...”</i> or <i>“back in my day...”</i> narrative.</p>
        
        <p>(After many such conversations, I’ve come to the conclusion that <b>everyone just wants to teach their younger self</b> since people always compare today’s students to who they were at that age, and end up shaping their teaching methods accordingly.)</p>
        
        <p>That said, I can’t ignore the fact that <i>many Austrian students are several years behind schedule</i>.<br>
        I personally know people who are more than three years behind, meaning they’ve spent more time off-track than the full length of their actual degree.</p>

        <p>From what I’ve understood, part of this has to do with how exams are structured: you’re expected to attend every exam session, and if you fail an exam four times, you must appear before a committee and explain yourself (or something along those lines).
        If you fail the fourth time as well, the exam is removed from your transcript for your current degree path.
        Also some exams, especially lab-based ones, are only offered once a year, which makes things even more difficult.</p>

        <p>So no, it’s not just the students’ fault.</p>
        
        <p>But in Italy, where university is expensive, the cost of living is high, and scholarships are rare unless you’re in <i>serious</i> financial difficulty, <b>I’ve never heard of anyone being more than two years behind</b>.</p>
        
        <p>Here, I know someone who’s 11 years into their bachelor’s degree.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Since the war in Ukraine began, Graz has seen an influx of both Russians and Ukrainians fleeing their countries. For example, <b>russian-speaking residents make up roughly 60-70% of the occupants at my dormitory</b>.</p>
        <p>For both nations, young men leave to avoid military conscription, as the boy I met who moved into the dorm just one week before his 18th birthday. However, there are also many women (not subject to conscription) because in Ukraine the university system has been severely disrupted, while expressing anti-government views in Russia has become very dangerous.</p>
        <p>Talking to the Russians, I could understand that leaving the country seems like an obvious choice for those who managed to escape. They can't understand why anyone would want to stay in a country so corrupt and problematic. Yet, many young people stay. Perhaps they ignore the problems, or perhaps they don't think about them. I didn't have trouble understanding what they meant, because it's exactly how I feel about Italy. And in my case, I also know many people who don't seek opportunities abroad. Of course, the reasons are different, but it was interesting to hear this same mindset from a very different perspective.</p>
        <p>One fascinating discovery was the existence of legally registered agencies across Europe that specialize in helping slavic youths relocate. These agencies assist with finding university placements, securing accommodation, handling necessary paperwork (both in their home country and in Europe), opening bank accounts, and obtaining a local phone number. Naturally, due to demand, their services aren’t cheap: budget options start at around €1.000, while the pricier ones can cost several thousand euros. Not only is it a very expensive solution, but it’s not a solution at all. In fact, in Russia the police continue to search for them in their homes, asking their parents where they are (who, to avoid trouble, <b>pretend to disown them</b>). It’s also common for relocated Russians to receive phone calls (in Russian) several times a semester, asking where they are and telling them they must come to enlist.</p>
        <p>Another noteworthy point is how much simpler the visa process is for Ukrainians compared to Russians. Ukrainians are eligible for political asylum, which comes with significant economic benefits, such as state financial support and a more straightforward bureaucratic process. Russians, on the other hand, face stricter requirements and receive no such support. Having had the chance to meet several Russians and learn about their history and the problems they’ve faced, it seems unfair to me, especially for the men who flee to avoid fighting for Russia (and thus, to avoid killing). I imagine these are the geopolitical consequences enacted against Russia. In a sense, I see them as the "<i>petty actions</i>" (at the expense of ordinary people) that world powers play out when they are unable to stop a war through diplomacy.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I found it interesting that <b>lots of Russian-language songs focus heavily on criticizing Russia</b>, its political issues, military decisions, and overall societal problems. They often dwell on nostalgia for the past, which, according to Russians I’ve met, seemed to be a much better time.</p>

            <li><b>Student exchange trips to Japan (paid):</b> exchange program where Austrian students show the city to visiting Japanese students, and later, the opposite happens in Japan.</li>
            <li><b>Competition for a free year of accommodation:</b> Writing competition on a social topic, consisting of a two-page essay, where the winner is chosen based on both the quality of the essay and their financial situation.</li>
            <li><b>Annual dormitory barbecue:</b> My dorm is part of a brand with residences across Austria. Once a year, they host a free party in Vienna for all students living in their dorms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From what I’ve heard, regular apartment buildings also have similar perks. Some include a gym, while others offer a multifunctional room with a projector and seating.</p>

        <p>One thing I really appreciate about Austria is the <b>abundance of public toilets</b>. In every public park I’ve visited, I’ve found large, clean facilities. Not just in parks: even in commercial areas and public squares, there are always public toilets available.</p>
        <p>It might seem like a small detail, but it actually makes a big difference. It really encourages you to stay outside longer, without having to worry about it. And it automatically solves a whole set of problems that usually come up when organizing outdoor events, which are very common in Austria.</p>
        <p>In Italy, every time you organize an event, you have to worry about renting portable toilets, which are expensive, dirty, and impractical.</p>
        <p>To me, this is one of those things that show a State that truly understands people’s needs and actually takes care of them.</p>

        <p>Just before moving to Graz, I had finished reading <i><a href="https://books.google.at/books/about/Cache_Lake_Country.html?id=_H68GwAACAAJ&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Cache Lake Country: Life in the North Woods</a></i>, which suggests a simple technique to orient yourself in any place: <i>pick a tall building and use it as a reference point</i>.</p>
        <p>The problem I faced in Graz was that <b>all the buildings are the same height, and very low</b>.</p>
        <p>Later, I found out that this is because <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/931" target="_blank">Graz is a UNESCO World Heritage site</a>, which means buildings can’t be torn down and replaced with new ones.<br>
So the city is full of beautifully preserved imperial buildings, and I guess that’s a fair excuse for making me feel lost every time I step outside.</p>
        <p>That said, it’s actually quite easy to get around in Graz, I’m just really bad at directions.</p>

        <p>To be honest, during the calendar year I spent in Graz, it barely snowed, just a few days, and not heavily.</p>

        <p>From what I’ve heard from people who actually use it, public transportation in Graz isn’t great.</p>
        <p>As a result, many people rely on cars (clogging up the roads) and even more people rely on bikes.</p>
        <p>To avoid letting their kids ride on the street, parents have come up with a whole range of alternative solutions that I’ve never seen in Italy. To be honest, to me <b>these setups look more dangerous</b> than just letting kids ride their bikes on the road, but people like that, so who am I to judge?</p>

        <p>The special feature (and the reason behind the name <i>Bausatz</i>, which means "<i>kit</i>" or "<i>assembly set</i>") is how you order: <b>you fill out a paper sheet by ticking off the ingredients you want</b>.</p>
        <p>This makes ordering easier for customers (you just hand over the sheet) and simplifies food preparation. Since everything is standardized, there’s no need for an elaborate menu or experienced chefs. Pretty much any student can handle it, and Graz is full of students.</p>

        <p>Of course, the food is just “<i>ok</i>”, but it’s cheap with student-friendly prices.</p>
        <p>I think this model has solved the biggest problems restaurants faced when Graz became a strongly university-oriented city: <b>low pricing and non-specialized staff</b>.</p>
        <p>This approach to dining also highlights, once again, the cultural difference with Italy, where small, often family-run restaurants are more common and appreciated.</p>
        <p>I’m quite sure that a <b>business model like this would fail in Italy</b>, where going out to eat is often seen as a special occasion, unlike in Austria, where it feels more like a casual, everyday thing.</p>

        <p>And it was as boring as I expected.</p>
        <p>But I can say that I’ve realized I will never become a gardener or a botanist.</p>
        <p>To avoid wasting time, I took the opportunity to create this gallery to help those looking for reasons to call me an idiot:</p>
