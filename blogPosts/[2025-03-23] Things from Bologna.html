            I spent the last month in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna" target="_blank">Bologna</a> (not really, I was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzola_dell%27Emilia" target="_blank">Anzola dell'Emilia</a>) (not really, I was in Palazzina di Sopra, which has no Wikipedia page...) working in corporate for the first and last time.
            <br>
            To recap the experience, I wrote in random order random stuff that caught my eye.
            <br>
            Don't expect anything, it's just a "<i>list of things</i>".

                On my first day in Anzola, I walked into a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trattoria" target="_blank">trattoria</a> with my parents.<br>
                The owner approached us in his thick Bolognese accent and asked, "<i>Did you book a table?</i>"<br>
                "<i>No</i>"<br>
                "<i>No problem, we’ll find you a spot!</i>"<br>
                He led us to a table with a reserved sign that read "<i>Luca</i>" (male name).<br>
                Turning to my mom, he said: "<i>For now, you’re Luca: go ahead and sit!</i>"<br>
                Then he put on a show of classic Italian hospitality:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>To my dad he joked, "<i>So, what are we feeding the wallet today?</i>"</li>
                    <li>He recommended dishes like a seasoned expert, with the pride of someone unveiling a treasure they’ve refined over years of hard work.</li>
                    <li>To a regular customer: "<i>See you before Easter?</i>"  
                        <p>The man shrugged, "<i>Not sure if I can make it before Thursday...</i>"</p>
                        <p>The owner shot back, "<i>You idiot, Easter’s on Sunday!</i>"</p>
                        <p>Noticing I’d overheard, he turned to me with a serious tone: "<i>Kid, study hard or you’ll end up like this guy!</i>"</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                The stereotype is true: <b>Italians are crazy about football</b>.<br>
                When the local team won an important final, Bologna celebrated until 2 AM, even though everyone had work the next day.<br>
                Bologna FC has such a passionate fanbase that it even has <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifoseria_del_Bologna_Football_Club_1909" target="_blank">its own Wikipedia page</a>.<br> 
                Not only: in the city you'll see themed store shutters everywhere, with each shop displaying scarves or fan symbols!

        <div class="giustifica">
            <p>Coming back to this idea that "<b>Bologna is a human city.</b>"</p>
            <p>
                On the bus from the periphery to downtown, there's this guy around 30 years old, wearing a camel-themed yellow motorcycle jacket with ordinary jeans.<br> 
                He carries just a small water bottle and nothing else. <br>
                I was struck by his face: the most ordinary imaginable, the face of someone who lets life happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                He greets half the bus, starts chatting with a woman about work, the weather, the passing years, how they'll clock in late because of traffic. <br>
                He waves to someone in a car outside the bus with the ease of someone accustomed to greeting many people. <br>
                He says hello to a little girl boarding with her mother. <br>
                He kisses a young woman on the cheek, probably a co-worker.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then the bus reaches his stop.<br> 
                He sighs like a Bolognese (not like a Milanese!), gets off, and heads to work. <br>
                Same as every other day, I imagine.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                He behaved so naturally that at first I thought he might have some mental disability, when in reality, he was probably just <i>kind</i>. <br>
                Funny how similar those two things can appear... <br>
                Probably I am simply not used to seeing behaviours that feels so genuinely normal.

                The buses have signs on the windows reminding seated passengers to buckle up.<br>
                It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this in Italy!<br>
                Of course, nobody does.

        <div class="giustifica">
            <p>
                When I visited <a href="../subpages/Conferences.html">Milan</a>, I found it cold, gray, and <b>unfit for human life</b>.<br>
                Bologna, on the other hand, feels <i>deeply human</i>.<br>
                It’s a city of people who share everyday struggles and support each other with empathy and warmth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Talking to locals, I was surprised to learn that <b>Bologna <i>aspires</i> to be Milan</b>.<br>
                It dreams of economic power, national influence, and cutting-edge tech dominance.<br>
                Yet I’m convinced it’ll never happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bologna is too sweet, too <i>alive</i>.<br>
                Its streets aren’t filled with sleek businessmen sprinting to meetings, they’re walked by laborers with tool belts and worn-out satchels.<br>
                The air doesn’t hum with "<i>I must rush to invoice</i>" but with "<i>I must rush to help my customer who needs me.</i>"
            </p>
            <p>
                The only thing these cities share?<br>
                Morning traffic rage.

                The bike lanes in the city center are placed <b>right in the middle of the road</b>. <br>
                Sandwiched between car lanes going both directions.  <br>
                I think this might be the most dangerous possible place to put cyclists.

                These aren't your typical flea markets with temporary stalls: they're massive, permanent stores packed with treasures. <br>
