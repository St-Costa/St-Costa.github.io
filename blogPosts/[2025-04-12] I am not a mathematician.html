                Studying mathematics is rewarding, working as a mathematician is not. <br>
                Moreover, the reputation of mathematicians made it difficult for me to find a job outside academia.

        <p class="giustifica">
            Between the ages of 6 and 20, intelligence is measured by grades and teachers’ opinions (because parents talk to each other).<br>
            Of less importance (though not irrelevant): extracurricular projects, hobbies, and personal inclinations.<br>
            By those standards, I was <i>pretty smart</i>: top grades, teacher’s pet, lots of side projects, heavy reading, and a weird passion for recursion.
        </p>    
        <p class="giustifica">
            Out of arrogance and hearsay, I held the "<i>intelligence</i>" skill in very high regard.<br>
            So going to university wasn’t optional: “<i>it’s what smart people do</i>,” and (as one of my teachers told me), “<i>at university you’ll find people like you!</i>”
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            The real question was which degree.
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            During high school, I did three internships as a programmer and didn’t like them.<br>
            Incompatible libraries, CMake, and Azure weren’t part of the work I wanted.<br>
            I was looking for something more... <i>intellectual</i>.
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            At one of those internships, I met a founder who explained that in math you work on algorithms, not on implementation.<br>
            That the mathematician’s job is to use logic and prove theorems.<br>
            And that his startup used mathematics to simulate pathologies and help doctors.
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            It was perfect!<br>
            Mathematics was the intellectual challenge I had been looking for:
            <ul>
                <li>Difficult and theoretical</li>
                <li>Goodbye Azure</li>
                <li>Useful and versatile</li>

        <p class="giustifica">
            From that perspective, mathematics was the right choice.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            In retrospect, I did well because I treated it like (what I believe to be) a startup project: something you love, something you believe in, something you're willing to do anything for.
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            I studied biomedical applications, so I also had the motivation of "<a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/#2-work-that-helps-others" target="_blank">helping humanity</a>" (or was it self-deception?).
            It seemed like the perfect job: doing what I love and helping the world!
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            Not just in terms of research: I liked the idea of teaching.
            I dreamed of holding a course where students come first, feedback is not ignored, and the material evolves.<br>
            (<a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/f0f98c0e-6209-4c97-8f66-b931ffaebe96" target="_blank">Being a professor is not the difficult part. Becoming one is.</a>)
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            I thought: "<i>If the mathematician's job is anything like studying math, it’ll be a piece of cake.</i>"<br>
            Not easy, but exciting, challenging, and satisfying.<br>
            But after a year of working as a mathematician, I discovered that it is very different...

            In a mobility project I worked abroad for 6 months on my master's thesis.<br>
            After graduation, I was hired in the same office as a researcher for 6 months.<br>
            Which means my observation is not statistically significant (N=1).

            This analysis, as far as possible, concerns all the (academic) mathematicians I have interacted with.<br>
            In fact, it’s <b>not</b> an analysis of <i>mathematicians themselves</i>, but rather of the <i>work</i> of a mathematician, which transforms passionate students into employees.

        <p class="giustifica">
            I mean: <i>don't hate the players, hate the game</i>.<br>

            <li>The <i>publish or perish</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="giustifica">
            I expected to find people like me: curious, eager to act, ready to help doctors with mathematics.<br>
            Instead, I found <i>employees</i>: trapped in a corporate system that forces them to <i>check the right boxes on the right form</i>.<br>
            A job that almost feels pitiful.
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            Forced to publish as many papers as possible.<br>
            Who split sparse results into two publications, "<i>just lengthen the 'Methods' section.</i>"<br>
            Who collaborate with professors just to have their name on the publications.<br>
            Who start projects only thinking about the paper and how popular the topic is.<br>
            Who have their performance evaluated based on the number of publications, not citations or impact factor.
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            A workplace where you follow orders.<br>
            Where you just have to push for the project, because "<i>we need to publish by this year.</i>"<br>
            Where no one knows anything about project management: "<i>Try this: if it works, it’ll look good in the paper.</i>"<br>
            Where corrections fix previous corrections.
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            And then, a classism that makes everything frustrating.<br>
            People with PhDs who think they know everything.<br>
            Discussions where your opinion doesn't count unless you have a PhD.<br>
            Meetings where the only right move is the one where you agree with the boss.

        <p class="giustifica">
            Mathematicians have a reputation among the other STEM fields.<br>
            They are "<i>special kids playing with theorems</i>," "<i>theorists uninterested in reality</i>," "<i>nerds who think they're smarter</i>."<br>
            (I consider the <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Math" target="_blank">xkcd comics</a> as a (not definitive) proof)
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            Not only that: the respect earned by advancing in academia becomes part of the academic's identity.<br>
            People are amazed when I tell them I am (was) a researcher, getting an apartment for rent is very easy, and interviews go well (sort of, see later).<br>
            I believe this is what generates the behaviors that fuel the stereotype of the snobbish academic in the ivory tower.
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            This image caused me problems when I looked for a new job.<br>
            After all, if I, an academic who was proud to be one just a few months ago, don’t like academics, how can they appeal to businessmen?
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            In companies, mathematicians are put to work doing data analysis, the "<i>nerdy stuff</i>" where you analyze numbers and create graphs.<br>
            In other positions, even junior ones where no experience is required, mathematicians are rejected.<br>
            To give you an idea: a couple of times I was turned down (the positions involved a training phase, and academic background mattered less), and in the same email, they offered me a position as an analyst.
        </p>
        <p class="giustifica">
            I believe they didn't want academics around.<br>
            And that's (part of) the reason why I’m writing this post.

            In the bachelor, you only take <i>introductory</i> courses because in graduate school you’ll have more advanced courses.<br>
            In graduate school, you need to do a thesis that will lead you to a PhD.<br>
            During your PhD, you need to collaborate with more researchers to open up more opportunities for a postdoc.<br>
            During the postdoc, you need to maintain good relationships to secure faculty positions.

            At the <a href="../subpages/fAI_Challenge.html">REAIM summit</a> I spoke with a new full professor who expressed disappointment with the job for two reasons:

        <ul class="giustifica">
            <li><u>It’s extremely bureaucratic</u>: hours-long meetings for bureaucratic issues (1 hour spent organizing the replacement of the department windows).</li>
            <li><u>No career opportunities</u>: at best, you can become a department chair, which leads to more bureaucratic issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="giustifica">
            (Surely, there are universities where it's an amazing job. Maybe the Ivy Leagues, or some university hidden in a faraway country. But the price of finding this position, and getting it, still seems disproportionate considering the risks.)
