                of retirement</a> made me realize that work can be more than something you just endure until retirement.
            It was one of the first posts that convinced me that self-employment was ultimately a lifestyle choice I
            wanted to make.

                People tend to think (...) that they will suddenly stop what they are doing after a certain age and let
                younger generations pay for their salary. <br>(...) <br>The problem with this mentality is that people
                rely on
                it
                too much. <br>They postpone their lives today and restrict themselves from doing what they want.<br> I
                have been
                acting like my job was a disease that will go away in the future.

            <a href="https://tala.bearblog.dev/your-life-is-not-a-prequel/" target="_blank">Your life is not a
                prequel</a> is a metaphor that PERFECTLY explains how I was living without realizing it. When I was in
            middle school, I thought, “<i>Real life begins in high school, when I turn 18...</i>”. In high school it
            became
            “<i>Real life begins in university when you study what you like and live without your parents</i>”. In
            university it was “<i>Real life begins when you work and have your own money</i>”. And so on, until I
            started
            working (as an employee) and thought “<i>Real life begins with retirement!</i>”.

                For so long, I've treated my life like a transitory period, an interlude. <br>(...) <br>I was always
                waiting, I
                recall. <br>(...)<br> I think I was waiting for a feeling of being prepared and enough. Once I am a
                better
                writer... Once I graduate... <br>(...)<br> I have come to realize that the procrastination,
                perfectionism, the
                ceaseless desire itself all come from the same place: a negation to inhabit the life unfolding right
                now.

                ONE!</b>”. When I worked at university and then in a corporation, <i>NOTHING</i> I saw worked well,
            <i>EVERYTHING</i> could have
            been done better, and <i>NO ONE</i> was interested in improving the situation. The extraordinary clarity of
            this post (and book!) made me realize that it's not my fault: I'm simply not cut out for those
            “pathological” places.

                Reflection is a dangerous pastime.<br>
                It can lead you to rewrite your past, alter how you see your present, and tempt you down paths you never
                imagined you would explore.<br>
                By my estimate, the material in this book has already triggered such hazardous reflection for thousands
                of people over the past four years.<br>
                It has triggered significant (and not always positive) career moves for dozens of people that I know
                of.<br>
                I myself am one of the victims of this book.

            given by corporate workers and university professors. Learning from others is a cheat code that I love, but
            when you realize you don't want to work as an employee, you can't follow the advice of those who have been
            doing that for a lifetime.

                The checklist could be something like:<br>
                1. Are there plausibly near-equal groups of people who need this advice versus the opposite advice?<br>
                2. Have you self-selected into the group of people receiving this advice by (...) being a fan of
                the blog / magazine / TV channel / political party / self-help-movement offering it?<br>
                3. Then maybe the opposite advice, for you in particular, is at least as worthy of consideration.
