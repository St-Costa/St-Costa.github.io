            <p>
                I spent two months writing this post, and now that I’m editing it for the blog, I'm self-employed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reading it again brings me back to the <i>transition</i> period between quitting my job and returning
                home
                (with no idea what came next).
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal was to create a kind of “<b>personal statement to the universe</b>,” marking my decision to
                stop
                working as an employee.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, I wasn’t sure whether to publish it or just keep it for myself.
                What convinced me was a friend who read it and said “It really left me with something.”
                And since this marks a big step in my life, publishing it feels like the right way to begin the next
                chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
                One last thing: the images and translation (from Italian) were done with ChatGPT.

                <p>
                <a href="I am not a mathematician.html">Academia isn’t for me</a>. I used to believe that
                research meant juggling ideas and advancing
                humanity’s scientific
                understanding.
                <br />
                Turns out, it’s a hellscape of publications and citation games.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I was realizing that, I came across the book <a
                    href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8044351-the-power-of-business-process-improvement"
                    target="_blank">The Power of Business Process Improvement</a>. That book gave me hope: maybe there
                <i>are</i> jobs where you analyze problems and solve them (much like the science I believed in)! So I
                thought: <i>“Why not try something more... business?”</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                After some research, the roles I was looking for turned out to be in <i>Operational Efficiency</i> and
                <i>Business Process Improvement</i>. At that stage, even figuring out the right roles felt
                like progress.
                <br />
                But like in every fairy tale, it didn’t take long to spot the catch: <b>those are corporate roles</b>.
                <br />
                Still, not knowing what I was getting into, I told myself <i>“Gotta start somewhere,”</i> and started
                applying.
            </p>
            <p>
                In those corporate positions, the preferred background is a degree in business management.
                <br />
                As a mathematician, I had to submit a <i>lot</i> of applications and go through three interviews before
                landing an offer: a 6-month internship in Italy as an <b>Operational Excellence Intern</b>, earning
                around
                <b>€7/hour</b>.
                <br />
                I expected the worst from a corporate role, but the interviews went surprisingly well: the HR rep was
                friendly and helpful; the supervisor was sharp, professional, and asked smart questions. I was sold: I
                accepted the offer without
                hesitation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>One month later, I quit.</b>

            <p>It can be divided into 3 phases</p>

            </h3>
            <p>
                On Day 1, I badged through three layers of security and felt like “This is a <i>serious</i> place.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I mean: the safety course at the digital kiosk, the corporate benefits brochure, the jaw-dropping
                production volumes... I walked through it all with wide eyes.</p>
            <p>
                Once I put on my PPE and stepped into the production area, I saw cutting-edge ⧫ manufacturing.
                <br />
                That wasn’t a normal site: it’s the company’s jewel.
                <br />
                “<i>And I’m here, ambitious and ready to contribute</i>”
            </p>
            <p>Then Day 2 happened.</p>

            <h3 id="the-ah-phase">
                <a href="#the-ah-phase">└─ The “<em>Ah</em>” phase</a>
            </h3>
            <p>The part where I actually do the job.</p>
            <p>
                In my case:
            <ul>
                <li>Sending out a PowerBI dashboard every morning</li>
                <li>Translating slides from English</li>
                <li>Measuring tables with tape measure to buy some panels</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                And the team’s work is not better:
            <ul>
                <li>Running health-checks (checklists)</li>
                <li>Teaching operators</li>
                <li>Many, many meetings</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                “<i>Ah. I came here to solve business problems and I’m translating slides.</i>”
            </p>

            </h3>
            <p>
                After a month, I had a 1:1 with my supervisor to plan the rest of the internship. Three projects were on
                the table:
            <ul>
                <li>2-3 months building a PowerBI automation</li>
                <li>Support one production line with organizing maintenance</li>
                <li>A TBD project to convince a stakeholder (e.g., the quality team) to hire me post-internship</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                My response was:
            <ul>
                <li>If I wanted to do data analysis (PowerBI etc.), I’d be doing it elsewhere at triple the salary
                    (remember: €7/h)</li>
                <li>I came here for operational efficiency, not people management</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer: “These are the team’s needs. There’s no flexibility.”
                <br />
                My answer: “Then this doesn’t align with my goals. I am done here.”
            </p>

                Beyond my assigned tasks, I saw so much dysfunction I couldn’t help but start taking notes.
                <br />
                A lot of notes. 10,000 words in just one month.

            <p>Here’s how my first day <i>actually</i> went.</p>
            <p>
                No one told me when to show up, so I arrived early. The receptionist didn’t know what to do and told me
                to call my supervisor.
                <br />
                “<i>I don’t have the number</i>”
                <br />
                “<i>I have it. We’ll call around 8.</i>”
                <br />
                We find out my supervisor was on vacation. We escalated to his manager, who came
                to pick me up at 9 like a parent picking up a lost kid at customer
                service.
            </p>
            <p>
                A week later: induction day.
                <br />
                Again: no one told me the time.
                <br />
                I had to crash the event and wasn’t even on the attendance list!
                <br />
                For an <b>obligatory</b> event where we had to sign documents!!!
            </p>
            <p>
                I quickly realize that “a big company works <i>only</i> if everything works well” is <b>bullshit</b>.
                The chaos is
                managed <i>just</i> enough to not collapse.
            </p>
            <p>
                People <i>inside</i> are the first to point this out, forced to “keep things afloat via WhatsApp
                messages and Teams calls”.
                <br />
                The same company that claims to be “one of the most advanced in the world,” flexing ISO certifications
                (= days full of meetings) ...and yet it runs on iPhones, Microsoft PCs, and outdated software.
            </p>
            <p>
                But still: the plant produces █–██ million ⧫ per day, sold at █$ per unit, across ██ operational lines,
                printing █B$ in global profits every █k employees.

                Central enough to attract young workers from the South (fleeing mafia and irregular labor) and
                immigrants (chasing a better life): a steady, self-replacing stream of labor; and north enough to pull
                in graduates from top universities for management roles. On top of that, the local man <i>loves</i>
                getting his hands dirty: the perfect profile to fill an army of ████ operators. This plant wouldn’t work

                the job, <i>it’s surviving the corporate environment</i>.
                <br />
                So hiring is done in bulk.
                <br />
                If someone quits? No big deal: easy to replace.
                <br />
                (I’d hear “Today is X’s last day” <i>every</i> week.)
                <br />
                If someone endures the corporate life and (optionally) knows how to do the job: great!
                <br />
                A new pawn gets promoted, and a new batch moves in. Besides manufacturing slaves for the C-level,
                this strategy fuels the narrative: <b>“Anyone can make it.”</b> Among the (low level) managers,
                you’ll find former machine operators, shop assistants, even cops. Not because they have rare skills,
                but because they could tolerate the system.

                Interns are a different story.
                <br />
                They’re usually graduates with degrees that don’t translate into jobs (I was the exception)
                <br />
                Basically: desperates. They’re thrown into <i>menial</i> tasks (to say the least…) and 90% of the time
                they’re not hired after the internship.
                <br />
                But is still a great deal! Not for them, for the company: internships are funded by the regional
                government.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s talk about machine operators. They’re people used to working with their hands, with strong manual
                skills, excellent spatial awareness, and work well together on the production floor.
                <br />
                The kind of people you want to keep the machines running.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, what does the team I landed in actually do?
                <br />
                Here’s how my supervisor explained it:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>"Our goal is to build a lean mindset.
                    In 20 years, resources will be scarce, but we can use this time to trigger a cultural shift.
                    Since operators are the ones doing the actual work, we (white collars) are the loss.
                    Our job is to make up for their lack of self-management by teaching them to become self-sufficient."
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                In practice: teaching operators how to do the job “by the standard”,
                and keeping them in check. How? By taking them from production and
                sticking them in a classroom with slides.
                <br />
                Then taking their supervisors, scoring their performance, and giving
                them grades.
            </p>
            <p>
                Put yourself in the shoes of an operator who’s been doing this
                for years.
                <br />
                He knows every part of the machine, can fix any issue, and sees the next
                ones coming.
                <br />
                Wearing oil-stained shirts and technician pants, he sees us show up in
                jeans and button-downs to explain that every time he cleans the machine,
                he has to fill out a form. And whenever there’s a problem (even a loose
                screw) he’s supposed to report it to the line lead, who logs it in the
                system, runs an assessment, solves it, and logs the solution back
                in.
            </p>
            <p>
                The plant runs on a fragile balance: a symbiosis between workers and
                machines.
                <br />
                Part of that balance relies on the operator’s personality. For its
                underpaid roles, the company hires <i>pragmatic profiles</i>, referred
                to as “monkeys” in internal jargon (even by upper management) (needless
                to say, I don’t endorse this degrading nickname). These workers aren’t known for
                programmatic, standardized maintenance, so the company hires managers to
                coach them, trying to prevent long-term machine failures. In short: it
                hires people <i>for</i> their practicality, then forces them to act
                <i>against</i> it, risking the very balance that keeps the whole
                system alive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company is fighting a war on two internal fronts, contradicting
                its own methods (see: <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/the-cannae-problem" target="_blank">The
                    Cannae
                    Problem</a>). Will it work?
                <br />
                Yes, but not how they think. People are learning how to game the system:
                they log <i>some</i> activities (just enough to show compliance),
                report KPIs only when they look good (otherwise it’s “N/A”), and run
                structured meetings <i>only</i> when someone’s watching. How could it
                work, anyway? This isn’t a solution.
                <br />
                The solution would be: hire different people.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not really a “people problem” you can solve with “people
                solutions”.
                <br />
                <b>The problem <i>is</i> the people</b>.
                <br />
                They fall into two archetypes (borrowed from <a
                    href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Gervaso#Raccolte_di_aforismi/#:~:text=Il%20grillo%20parlante" target="_blank">an italian

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The conformist (the willing slave)</li>
                <li>The ambitious (the one who obeys now, hoping to command later)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The first is the machine operator: the average Italian, obsessed with
                football, ultra-conservative traditionalist, whose biggest dream is
                retirement. He doesn’t want new frameworks and complains about every new
                tool.
                <br />
                The second is the opportunistic manager, a <a

                    Principle sociopath-in-training</a>. Secretly loyal to hierarchy, but
                never shows it (to avoid antagonizing the conformists around him). He
                obeys with strategic discipline, hoping to rise to the top of the
                pyramid.

                <b>The company is inherently pathological because is built out of what sabotages it.</b>
                <br />
                It’s a problem that can’t be solved, because it’s not just <i>compatible</i> with the company’s
                existence, the company actually
                <i>depends</i> on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This led me to wonder: <i>If the problem is the people... why do the people stay?</i>

                When they told me there’s a free gym, free bus pass, and free

                This is the bullshit that got me, and the same kind that convinces people to stay.

                And the company offers plenty: €100 bonuses for Christmas and birthdays,

                day, a free therapist, book clubs… It’s the only way to make the job
                bearable: distract with anything <i>except</i> the job itself.
                <br />
                I mean: a €100 annual voucher sounds better than €8.50 more in your
                paycheck.

                Italians have a complicated relationship with their country.
                “<i>Italy is the most beautiful country in the world</i>” but then
                “<i>Politics is a disaster, salaries are low, taxes are insane...</i>”
                <br />
                When I told interns about opportunities abroad, they’d reply “<i>Then why did you come back?</i>” with
                that smug undertone “<i>You love
                    Italy too much, huh?</i>”
                <br />
                Like the golden prison employees, they
                survive on cognitive dissonance. They <i>know</i> things are
                better elsewhere, but say they love Italy too much to leave: the food,
                the sea, the family...
                <br />
                From birth Italians are molded to <b><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Simp"
                        target="_blank">simp</a> for
                    their country</b>, and politicians, well knowing this, exploit the
                <i>nostalgia effect</i>.
                <br />
                Instead of fixing structural problems, they lure talent back from abroad
                (<a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/06/italy-facts-of-the-day.html"
                    target="_blank">a

                I hoped to connect with the other interns by sharing the ideas from
                this post, but I realized they had no perspective. “<i>I just want a
                    normal job. One where I leave at 5pm and don’t have to think about
                    anything. As long as they pay me, I’m good.</i>”
                <br />
                How does a 25-year-old
                end up with that as a life vision? I believe it’s the country: its work
                culture, its universities (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhv-phsugaI" target="_blank">lots to

                <br />
                Corporate life looks like a safe way out. It pulls
                them in with an appealing job application, traps them with perks, holds
                them for 40 years and retirement sneaks up without warning. Decades
                doing the same thing, in the same 2m^2, producing the same ⧫ every day.
                Decades decided in a few months of desperate job searching.

                <i>the vision</i>.
                <br />
                A guy, maybe 20 years old, was managing deliveries
                from the warehouse.
                <br />
                He was slouched in his chair like someone who had been sitting there all
                day.
                <br />
                At the computer, holding a roll of tape trying to find the end of it.
                <br />
                Five minutes passed, same position, still searching, with no success.
                <br />
                A
                young mind, capable of who knows what, being paid to find the end of a
                roll of tape.
                <br />
                Something hit me.
                <br />
                It was sadness, sharp and overwhelming.
                <br />
                I understood and I wanted to do
                something.
                <br />
                I wanted to shake him.
                <br />
                To wake him up.
                <br />
                To sound like a lunatic if I had to, but tell him to get out.<br />
                That he could do anything with his life.<br />
                That the world is full of opportunities.<br />
                That he was wasting his time with that roll of tape, at that desk, in
                that company.
                <br />
                I wanted to do the same with the other interns.<br />
                To break the corporate trance.<br />
                Not just them: I wanted to tell <i>everyone</i>. They all deserve to
                know.
                <br />
                <b>What are you doing? Do you not see where you’ve ended up?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Then the other guy came out, handed me the PPE, I said thanks, and walked back to my office.
            </p>

            <p>
                I deeply believe that understanding the <i>concept of value</i> is
                one of the most important skills a person can develop.
                <br />
                From product pricing to the value of time, it underpins everything.
                Living alone has drastically sharpened this skill for me (though I
                wouldn’t claim to have mastered it yet) and one of the most powerful
                (and perhaps underrated) tools that helped me is
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement"
                    target="_blank">BATNA</a>.
                <br />

                of action if negotiations fail.
            </p>
            <p>The corporate job is a subtle game of value. The most
                pathological belief is that money is the only value at stake.<br />
                This ignores, for instance, the <b>value of identity</b>:
                <i>“What is the cost of becoming the person you want to become?”</i>
                Spending years in a company means <i>growing inside it</i> and
                <i>being shaped to fit its walls</i>.
            </p>

                    The deal makes sense until I have enough money to comfortably avoid
                    homelessness, then each dollar gets less and less valuable, but society
                    only has a default template to buy most of us in five-day-a-week batches
                    whether you like it or not.

            <br />

            <p>
                Once I got the job, friends asked: <i>“What do you do? How much are you making?”</i>
                <br />
                No one asked: <i>“At what cost?”</i>
                <br />
                To most people, <i>cost</i> just means money. And money flows one way: from company to employee.
                <br />
                But we’re talking about <i>value</i>, and money is only a part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a company like this, the cost is <b>the death of ambition</b>. Why would an intern, hired after
                months of job
                searching, even consider leaving?
                <br />
                They convince themselves this is as good as it gets, and settle.
                <br />
                Week after week, they start hoping they can stay forever. Maybe climb the
                ladder.
                <br />
                Their BATNA? Staying on even worse terms than the ones they have
                now.
                <br />
                In their defense: it’s also a cultural issue: in Italy the highest
                aspiration is a permanent contract, entrepreneurship is treated like
                gambling, and job hopping is frowned upon.
            </p>
            <p>
                I almost fell for it too: the situation was tough, but that company
                name would’ve looked <i>shiny</i> on a résumé. Still, when I assessed
                the psychological cost, it was too high.
                <br />
                Given my background and financial situation, my BATNA was simple: quit, and find something
                better.
                <br />
                I negotiated (<a href="https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/"
                    target="_blank">always
                    negotiate!</a>).
                <br />
                We couldn’t find alignment.
                <br />
                I walked away.
                <br />
                BATNA!

                I lived that month like someone who had surrendered.
                <br />
                I (literally) dreamed of being reprimanded for messing up the report.
                <br />
                I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TrentTheTraveler" target="_blank">vanlife</a> videos to
                forget the frustration.
                <br />
                I tracked my supervisor’s football team to predict his mood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people are happy doing this kind of job: my parents were, some interns are.
                <br />
                I can’t. And I blame myself, because things would be easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know, I know: “Life is hard, and there’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem"
                    target="_blank">no free lunch</a>”
                <br />
                I have no illusion that things are simple outside the corporate world.
                <br />
                But says Murakami: “<i>I can bear any pain as long as it has a meaning.</i>” and manufacturing ⧫ isn’t
