        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I am Stefano Costa, a Master's student in Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.unitn.it/">University of Trento</a>, following the <a href="https://offertaformativa.unitn.it/en/lm/mathematics/course-programme"><i>Mathematics and Statistics for Life and Social Sciences</i></a> curriculum, in the <i>Modelling and Simulation for Biomedical Applications</i> track.</p>
        <p>I graduated with honors in Mathematics from the University of Trento. During my undergraduate studies, I explored various branches of mathematics, and developed a strong interest in numerical analysis and mathematical applications. In my master's program, I focused on the applications of mathematics in cardiovascular medicine, studying cardiovascular models and electrophysiological applications.</p>
        <p>I am currently in Graz to complete my master's thesis in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.uni-graz.at/en/">University of Graz</a>.</p>
        <p>You can find me here:

        <h2>What motivates me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I enjoy reading and consider it an important hobby to balance work and relaxation. I am also passionate about music, which I often listen to while working.</p>
        <p>I am very curious and enthusiastically participate in meetings because I love learning about mathematical and programming topics I am not yet familiar with. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence and its applications in the cardiovascular field.</p>

        <h2>My Working Style</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In Graz, I improved my time and project management skills to handle all the tasks required for my thesis. I consider myself a skilled programmer with a broad knowledge of many programming languages. Over the years, through university studies and various projects, I have also developed strong skills in LaTeX.</p>
        <p>To work efficiently, I often listen to background music (using headphones!) and tend to immerse myself in my world of productivity and to-do lists. Despite the music, I prefer working in a quiet office with a dedicated meeting room.</p>
        <p>Usual timetable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work: 9:00 - 12:00</li>
            <li>Lunch: 12:00 - 13:00</li>
            <li>Work: 13:00 - 16:30</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Favourite software:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>: note <i>making</i> software</li>
            <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>: code editor</li>
            <li><a href="https://t.me/St_Costa">Telegram</a>: messaging app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to work with me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I value sincerity and transparency in my coworkers. I enjoy frequent exchanges on how to improve our work together. I appreciate constructive criticism as there is always room for improvement. I expect my coworkers to be open to suggestions as well.</p>
        <p>In a team, I seek a collaborative group. I want to be on the same wavelength with everyone, and I particularly appreciate being updated on the progress of each member's work, so we can all intervene together if problems arise.</p>
        <p>Contact me via email (response time: 1 day) or Telegram (response time: 1 hour). For long and detailed messages (which I prefer), email is better.</p>
        <p>When joining an established group or starting a new project, I prefer to have some time for independent research first. Then, I like to hear the opinions of those with experience in the field or who have previously worked on the project. After these steps, I work very independently.</p>
