        <p>During my Master's degree, I have had numerous opportunities to explore a wide range of applications of mathematics through <a href="./Academic_projects.html">courses</a> and seminars. However, it was through direct interactions with researchers and industry professionals that I gained a deeper understanding of real-world applications, including their possibilities and limitations. These insights sparked my interest in biomedical applications, hoping one day to work on projects for the development of tools for medical support and healthcare improvement.</p>
        <p>In general, I am interested in the <b>applications of mathematics</b> to other branches of science. In particular, my goal is to broaden my experience in <b>cardiovascular applications</b>, in the academic, clinical, and business settings.
        <p>I would like to work on a project involving the application of <b>machine learning</b>, which is proving to be an important tool in the biomedical context. As an example, in Graz I was particularly interested in the applications of machine learning to <b>cardiac tissue mechanics</b> and <b>cardiac electrophysiology</b>.</p>
