        <p class="bottom_space giustifica">
            A simple dark theme for Obsidian, inspired by the design of this website.
            I focused on a clean layout with an emphasis on <a href="https://coolors.co/contrast-checker" target="_blank">good contrast colors</a> for better readability.

        <p class="bottom_space giustifica"> 
            DietPlanner is a tool for proactive meal planning, designed to help users working toward body recomposition or similar nutrition goals. 
            As often happens, I started this project to solve a personal problem: I wanted to plan my meals in advance, but most existing apps are built for real-time tracking. 
            I also wanted something <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app" target="_blank">file over app</a> like <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>, so I took this occasion to learn Electron.

        <p class="bottom_space giustifica"> 
            After reading a lot of posts on HN, I realized it’s common to have a personal website to share projects, ideas, and updates about work and life. 
            So, after years, I went back to HTML, CSS, and JS (feel free to laugh when you check the repo...). 
            I considered using something more modern like React, but I wanted to keep things simple and not get lost in new tech.

        <p class="bottom_space giustifica"> My story was selected as one of the eight winners of the global UN competition "Sci-fAI Challenge". The competition involved writing a short story that explored the implications of AI on peace, security and warfare. As a winner, I was invited at the "Responsible AI in the Military domain Summit" (REAIM) to share my ideas on how artificial intelligence can shape peace-building and global security.</p>

        <p class="bottom_space giustifica"> 
            During this academic period, I focused on assignments.
            These included the simulation of cardiovascular pathologies, modeling the impact of treatments, and the analysis of the computational complexity of DNA sequencing algorithms.

We developed a Scratch-based game to teach middle school students Mendel’s genetics principles. Additionally, we created an Italian-language tutorial on Wikiversity to guide users in recreating the game.</p>

    <h2>2023</h2>

    <div class="list_div bottom_space_big">
        <h3 class="inline">Words Flow,</h3>
        <h4 class="inline"><i>Podcast</i></h4>
        <h5 class="left not_so_bold bottom_space"><a href="https://www.lucanesler.com/" target="_blank">My friend website [ITA]</a></h5>
        <p class="bottom_space giustifica"> 
            To promote a friend's writing services, we considered launching a podcast.
            <a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/02390a03-feff-4a01-b4dc-b8deeb918025" target="_blank">People listen to podcasts for entertainment</a>, <a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/a51fb44e-5972-46c0-8450-34fe57fc236e" target="_blank">but need the illusion of usefulness</a>.
            So, each episode tackled a deep, complex topic, made engaging through my friend’s experience.
            For the structure, we took inspiration from the <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/podcast" target="_blank">Building a Second Brain Podcast</a>: short, dense episodes, centered on a single topic.
            We designed a logo, recorded 3 episodes, and gathered feedback. But in the end, we realized that the time required for editing and publishing wasn’t worth the effort.
            Still, the process taught us a lot about the podcasting world (competitors, optimal episode length, branding challenges, how hard it is to monetize...), and about the real cost of time in a business.

    <h2>2018</h2>

    <div class="list_div bottom_space_big">
        <h3 class="inline">Knurled Chicken Head,</h3>
        <h4 class="inline"><i>Band</i> + <i>Album</i></h4>
        <h5 class="left not_so_bold bottom_space"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3lw51j3iW73cBnozLieBNP" target="_blank">Album on spotify [ITA]</a></h5>
        <p class="bottom_space giustifica"> 
            For four years, I played drums in Knurled Chicken Head (name's inspired by <a href="https://www.boxguitar.com/en/search?controller=search&s=CHICKEN+HEAD" target="_blank">knobs</a>), an original band based in Bolzano. 
            It was my first dive into creative collaboration, where I learned to navigate group dynamics and creative disagreements. 
            While we had energy and ideas, we lacked structure: our songwriting suffered from limited music theory knowledge, vocals were our weakest element, and we underestimated marketing focusing only on live shows. 
            The breaking point came when trying to balance midnight rehearsals with 6am university commutes, but the deeper truth was realizing I didn't want to "<i>become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq5VPV5c13I" target="_blank">musician</a> when I grew up</i>" (as <a href="../blogPosts/[2025-04-12] I am not a mathematician.html">with mathematics</a>) hauling gear at 2am after a gig lost its charm fast).
