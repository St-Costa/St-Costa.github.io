            A simple dark theme for Obsidian, inspired by the design of this website.
            I focused on a clean layout with an emphasis on <a href="https://coolors.co/contrast-checker" target="_blank">good contrast colors</a> for better readability.

            DietPlanner is a tool for proactive meal planning, designed to help users working toward body recomposition or similar nutrition goals. 
            As often happens, I started this project to solve a personal problem: I wanted to plan my meals in advance, but most existing apps are built for real-time tracking. 
            I also wanted something <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app" target="_blank">file over app</a> like <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>, so I took this occasion to learn Electron.

            After reading a lot of posts on HN, I realized it’s common to have a personal website to share projects, ideas, and updates about work and life. 
            So, after years, I went back to HTML, CSS, and JS (feel free to laugh when you check the repo...). 
            I considered using something more modern like React, but I wanted to keep things simple and not get lost in new tech.

            Final-year high school exam project developed with my friend: a fully functional RFID-based bike sharing system. It features a multilingual web platform (HTML, PHP, JS), a MySQL database, and a physical simulator built with Raspberry Pi, RFID reader, LEDs, LCD, and buttons inside a 3D-printed case. The system handles real-time user authentication, bike selection, rental tracking, and balance deduction.
            It was the first time I built a project that felt like it could become something <i>real</i>, a proof that building this kind of solution is more within reach than most people think. Indeed, just a year later bike-sharing systems appeared in our city!

            During my second year of high school (16yo), my classmates and I spent the whole year playing Cookie Clicker on a shared account. Inspired by that, I built my own sports-themed idle game, packed with inside jokes and small memes. I rediscovered it in 2025 and laughed for ten minutes straight. It’s a perfect reminder that I’ve always built things just for the fun of it, but also because I’ve always loved challenging myself and learning by doing.

        <h5 class="left not_so_bold bottom_space"></h5>
        <p class="bottom_space giustifica"> 
            Together with a software engineer friend, we wanted to build an online tool for book layout and formatting. We knew the problems of the industry: the traditional process is <b>slow</b>, <b>expensive</b>, and handled by designers using <b>complex tools</b>. Our idea was to simplify it: make a tool even authors could use, and with enough depth to serve as a power-tool for designers too. We imagined template libraries, author profiles, and the ability to share layout presets. During market research we discovered two big and established competitors. Both were polished, had solved the hardest technical challenges, and used a one-time payment model: hard to compete with as a small team. Also one was built by someone teaching <i>how to get rich selling kindles</i>, the other was positioned as its rival. We shelved the idea, but got the point: sometimes good will is not enough.

        <h5 class="left not_so_bold bottom_space"><a href="https://www.lucanesler.com/" target="_blank">My friend website [ITA]</a></h5>
        <p class="bottom_space giustifica"> 
            To promote a friend's writing services, we considered launching a podcast.
            <a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/02390a03-feff-4a01-b4dc-b8deeb918025" target="_blank">People listen to podcasts for entertainment</a>, <a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/a51fb44e-5972-46c0-8450-34fe57fc236e" target="_blank">but need the illusion of usefulness</a>.
            So, each episode tackled a deep, complex topic, made engaging through my friend’s experience.
            For the structure, we took inspiration from the <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/podcast" target="_blank">Building a Second Brain Podcast</a>: short, dense episodes, centered on a single topic.
            We designed a logo, recorded 3 episodes, and gathered feedback. But in the end, we realized that the time required for editing and publishing wasn’t worth the effort.
            Still, the process taught us a lot about the podcasting world (competitors, optimal episode length, branding challenges, how hard it is to monetize...), and about the real cost of time in a business.

        <h5 class="left not_so_bold bottom_space"><a href="https://www.etsy.com/about" target="_blank">Etsy</a></h5>
        <p class="bottom_space giustifica"> 
            For a few months, I worked on launching an Etsy shop with a graphic designer friend. 
            The plan was simple: sell <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/popular_printables" target="_blank">printable products</a>. 
            We explored several directions but focused on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=printable+quotes&ref=search_bar&dd_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fmarket%2Fpopular_printables%3Finstant_download%3Dtrue" target="_blank">quotes</a>, where we saw clear space for improvement. 
            But we quickly hit a harsh wall: the Italian business regulations. 
            Beyond the percentage cut from each sale, just opening a business in Italy means facing a mandatory fixed tax (IRPEF), around €2000 a year regardless of profit. 
            For a venture built around 2-3€ products, the math didn’t add up. 
            It was my first taste of how (Italian...) regulation can crush experimentation, and it validated what many freelancers in Italy say: the state isn’t on your side.
            <br>
            <u>NB</u>: now I don't consider it a <i>good business</i>, but a <i>good experiment</i> for a 18 years old!

            It was my first dive into creative collaboration, where I learned to navigate group dynamics and creative disagreements. 
            While we had energy and ideas, we lacked structure: our songwriting suffered from limited music theory knowledge, vocals were our weakest element, and we underestimated marketing focusing only on live shows. 
            The breaking point came when trying to balance midnight rehearsals with 6am university commutes, but the deeper truth was realizing I didn't want to "<i>become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq5VPV5c13I" target="_blank">musician</a> when I grew up</i>" ((as <a href="../blogPosts/[2025-04-12] I am not a mathematician.html">with mathematics</a>) hauling gear at 2am after a gig lost its charm fast).
